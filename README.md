## Life in Weeks
    Date: 2022-06-27
    Description: This simple program will calculate how long you will have left to live in days, weeks and months. 
    The concept for this comes from Tim Urban's [blog post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).
    Tim uses the premiss that the average human life span is now close to 90 years, so it will take your current age and show you how long you have until you die.
